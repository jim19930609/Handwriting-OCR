This is a test case of the text recognition proiects
Text in images and Iideo frames caries important information for Kisual
content understanding and retrieal In this papery by using multiscale
aelet featuresy e propose a noel coarsertoxfine algorithm that is able
to locate text lines en under complex background Firsty in the coarse
detectiony after the aelet energy feature is calculated to locate al posible
text pixelsy a densitybased region groBing method is deloped to conect
these pixels into regions hich are further separated into candidate text
lines by structural informations Secondlys in the fine detectiony Iith four
kinds of texture features extracted to represent the texture patern of a
text lines a forard search algorithm is aplied to select the most efectie
SD featuresy SD
Finaly an SVM clasifier is used to identify true text from the candidates
based on the selected features Experimental results shor that this aproach
can fast and robustly detect text lines under arious conditions
