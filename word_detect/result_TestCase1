This is a test case Of the text recognition projects
Text in Images and Mideo frames caries important information for Misual
content understanding and retrieal In this papers by using multiscale
aelet features 1e propose A noel coarsestosfine algorithm that is able
to locate text lines en under complex background Firsty in the coarser
detections after the aelet enerBy feature Is calculated to locate al posible
text pixelsy a densityrbased region groing method is deloped to conect
these pixels into regions hich are further separated into candidate text
lines by structural informations Secondlye in the fine detectiony ith four
Kinds of texture features extracted to represent the texture patern of a
text lines d forard search algorithm is apled to select the most efectie
featuresy
Finaly an sVm clasier is used to identifty true text from the candidates
based on the selected featuresy Experimental results shor that this aproach
can fast and robustly detect text lines under karious conditionsy
